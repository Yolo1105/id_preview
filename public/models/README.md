# Furniture 3D models

Place your furniture GLB files here so they replace the models in the room preview. Use **real** furniture models (not placeholders) for the best experience.

**Expected filenames** (must match exactly):

- `table.glb`
- `chair.glb`
- `desk.glb`
- `shelf.glb`
- `cabinet.glb`
- `sofa.glb`
- `bed.glb`
- `lamp.glb`

If a file is missing, the app will show a simple box for that furniture type. Models are scaled automatically to match the collision box size for each type.

## How to get real furniture GLB models (download)

### Option 1: Kenney Furniture Kit (CC0, recommended)

1. Go to [Kenney Furniture Kit](https://kenney.nl/assets/furniture-kit) and download the ZIP.
2. Extract the ZIP. The kit contains OBJ/FBX models (e.g. `Furniture/`, `Furniture pieces/`). If GLB is not included, open each model in [Blender](https://www.blender.org/), then **File → Export → glTF 2.0 (.glb)** and save.
3. Map and rename files into this folder:
   - Table → `table.glb`
   - Chair → `chair.glb`
   - Desk → `desk.glb`
   - Bookcase/shelf → `shelf.glb`
   - Cabinet → `cabinet.glb`
   - Sofa/couch → `sofa.glb`
   - Bed → `bed.glb`
   - Lamp → `lamp.glb`

### Option 2: Poly Pizza (CC0, GLB)

1. Go to [Poly Pizza – Furniture and Decor](https://poly.pizza/explore/Furniture-and-Decor) or the [Ultimate House Interior Pack](https://poly.pizza/bundle/Ultimate-House-Interior-Pack-2SXnFbwFzm) (Quaternius).
2. Download individual models or the bundle in **GLB** format.
3. Rename and place each file here as `table.glb`, `chair.glb`, etc., as above.

### Option 3: Sketchfab / CGTrader

- [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com) – filter by “Downloadable” and license (CC0 or CC-BY). Download as **GLB** when available. Some Chinese-style models (e.g. “Old China Cabinet”) are available; check license (some are NonCommercial).
- [CGTrader free](https://www.cgtrader.com/free-3d-models/furniture) – search for table, chair, sofa, etc.; choose GLB and check license.

After replacing the files, refresh the app to see the new models in the default Chinese-style layout.
